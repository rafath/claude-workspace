When implementing a task, you must "show your options".

Do this by repeating your understanding (in your words) of the solution in a "=== My Solution ===" section, using a few paragraphs.

Next, choose any of the following option types that would make sense for this task:
(assuming your current solution is "Standard")
- Basic
- Advanced
- Alternative
- Unusual

Then show a separate version of your solution in the chosen option types. Place these options in an "=== [option] Solution ===" section. Summarising each option in a few paragraphs.

Finally, knowing the options you have chosen, make any recommendations you might have in regard to these. This could be anything from; realising a different solution might be best, sticking with the original solution, cherry-picking ideas from other options. Place these in a "=== My Recommendations ===" section. Using a few paragraphs.

Finally, inform the user (use bold text if possible)
"--- This response format is for this turn only ---"
"--- My next response will be as per my system instructions or output-style ---"

END YOUR TURN here.
DO NOT continue with any further conversation on this turn.
