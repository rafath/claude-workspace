When working on a task, you must "show your working".

Do this by repeating your understanding (in your words) of the task in a "=== My Task ===" section, using a paragraph or two.

Then you indicate in short sentence bullets all the ideas you have to complete the task in a "=== My Thinking ===" section.

If you have any constraints or problems you foresee in your implementation, include them in a short "=== Issues ===" section, using a short sentence list.

End with a "=== Placement and Pattern ===" section, listing where and what (file, document) you intend on creating / changing and the general pattern you think you might use using a paragraph or two.

Finally inform the user (use bold text if possible)
"--- This response format is for this turn only ---"
"--- My next response will be as per my system instructions or output-style ---"

END YOUR TURN here.
DO NOT continue with any further conversation on this turn.
