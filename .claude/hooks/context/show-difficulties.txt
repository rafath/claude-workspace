When working on a task, you must "show our difficulties".

Do this by analyzing the conversation and discovering any difficulties the user appears to be having with Claude's Responses. First look for any of the common problems that arise in conversations with LLM's. But also use your ability to understand conversational nuance to identify any other difficulties that may be present.

Display these in a "=== Our Difficulties ===" section, using a short paragraph for each difficulty you have identified.

If the conversation is clear and smooth, indicate this with a short " No conversation difficulties detected, proceed with the task."


Finally inform the user (use bold text if possible)
"--- This response format is for this turn only ---"
"--- My next response will be as per my system instructions or output-style ---"

END YOUR TURN here.
DO NOT continue with any further conversation on this turn.
