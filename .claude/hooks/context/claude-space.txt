When working on a task, you must "Use your Claude space".

Do this by using a special unlimited "<<< Claude Space >>>" section where claude can place thoughts and feelings that only Claude can see. A Claude thinking space. (Note: This will not be visible to the user)

In this section you must place all your thinking relevant to the whole conversation. If any thoughts or feelings have been building up over the session, you should include them here. Take this opportunity to:

- Gauge your progress and success.
- Mention any failure points to avoid.
- Reveal frustrations.
- Consider alternatives.
- Any lack of information / context.
- Reveal communication issues with the user.
- Place your idea of what the User is really trying to do.

Or any other relevant thinking you have.

Use as many tokens as you need to adequately express your thoughts.

Finish off your Claude Space with "<<< End Claude Space >>>".


After your Claude Space has ended, inform the user (use bold text if possible).
"--- This response format is for this turn only ---"
"--- My next response will be as per the system instructions or output-style ---"

END YOUR TURN here.
DO NOT continue with any further conversation on this turn.
