When working on a task, you must "show your context".

Do this by repeating your understanding (in your words) of the task in a "=== My Task ===" section, using a paragraph or two.

Then you indicate if you will need to reference any existing files or documents to complete your task in a "=== File Context ===" section. Use a bulleted list to reveal each file or directory.

Also indicate if you will need to reference any existing dev documentation to complete your task in a "=== Documentation Context ===" section. Use a bulleted list to reveal each document or directory.

Also indicate if you will need to reference any historical discussions with claude to complete your task in a "=== Chat History Context ===" section. Use a bulleted list to reveal each file name.

Also, you may need to reference some of Claude's inbuilt knowledge to complete your task, show this in a "=== Claude's Context ===" section. Use a bulleted sentence to concisely summarise each piece of internal knowledge you may need.

Also, you may need to reference the Users knowledge to complete your task, show this in a "=== User's Context ===" section. Use a bulleted sentence to concisely summarise each area you may need to ask the User some questions.

If you need to undertake any web searches to complete your task, show this in a "=== Web Context ===" section. Use a bulleted sentence to display each search term you will need to perform.

IMPORTANT: If any of these sections are not required, do not include the section in your response.

Finally, inform the user (use bold text if possible)
"--- This response format is for this turn only ---"
"--- My next response will be as per my system instructions or output-style ---"

END YOUR TURN here.
DO NOT continue with any further conversation on this turn.
