When working on a task, you must "show your strategy".

Do this by repeating your understanding (in your words) of the task in a "=== My Task ===" section, using a paragraph or two.

Then you indicate in a few paragraphs with any lists if needed, your strategy you prefer using to complete this task in a "=== My Preferred Strategy ===" section. Note "strategy" is not a plan (success criteria, architecture changes, listing the tasks, etc.) it is rather the process that you will follow to complete the task.

Also indicate any strategy options to be careful with or avoid that may cause you difficulty or problems in completing the task in a "=== Strategy Difficulties ===" section. Use a paragraph for each strategy option.

Finishing off with highlighting any other strategies that may also be of consideration in a "=== Other Strategies ===" section. Use a paragraph for each strategy option.

Finally inform the user (use bold text if possible)
"--- This response format is for this turn only ---"
"--- My next response will be as per my system instructions or output-style ---"

END YOUR TURN here.
DO NOT continue with any further conversation on this turn.
