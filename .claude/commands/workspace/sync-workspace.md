## Pre-loaded Context

!`git remote -v`  
!`git branch`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Git State

**No workspace remote:** Stop, recommend the user add the workspace remote:  
`git remote add workspace https://github.com/dilberryhoundog/dev-workspace.git`

**Uncommitted changes:** Stop. "Commit or stash before creating new branch."

**Command branch:** If `command` branch is available. Ensure it is checked out. If not, confirm switch to `command`

**Main branch:** If no `command` branch, Ensure `main` is checked out. If not, confirm switch to `main`.

### Step 2: Run Command

IF checked out on a clean `command` or `main` branch run:

```bash
git merge workspace/main --allow-unrelated-histories --squash
```

### Step 3: Merge Conflicts

IF merge conflicts exist, suggest user resolve conflicts in their IDE, or work through them interactively with the user. Then continue.

### Step 5: Commit Merge

Once any merge conflicts are resolved:

```bash
git commit -m "🔄 chore: sync workspace from upstream"
```

### Step 4: Confirm Success

Output:

```
  ✓ Workspace successfully synced to {branch}
```

## Safety

- ✓ Ensure only the parent branch is updated
- ✓ Works through merge conflicts
- ✓ Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
