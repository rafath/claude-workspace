This is a new release from 37signals. it is litterally a production grade issues tracker but they have realeased it as open source (with all commit history too) also. The lisence allows personal usage. Anyway I want to use this as a modern rails reference, extracting all the patterns and modifying them for use in my other applications. This claude.md file i want to contain a brief overview of the application, its tech stack, then the rest of the file be all the referenced patterns, things like magic link login, accounts, rich text editior, application.html setup. each pattern should have a heading and a few paragraphs expalaining it, minimal critical code examples are welcome also.
