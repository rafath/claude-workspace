Comprehensive codebase sweep to gather context relevant to branch purpose. Run once per branch, reference throughout.

If any sections are blank, agent uses workspace context and branch purpose to guide discovery.

In your search give specific focus to any checked sections.

- [ ] **Files** - listing relevant files with explanations
- [ ] **Relationships** - How files/components connect and depend on each other
- [ ] **Patterns & Conventions** - Coding patterns, naming conventions, architectural patterns
- [ ] **Data Flow** - How data moves through the system
- [ ] **Architecture** - Key architectural decisions and boundaries
- [ ] **Configuration** - Relevant config files and settings
- [ ] **Test Coverage** - Test files revealing usage patterns
- [ ] **Documentation** - READMEs, design docs, ADRs
- [ ] **Ambiguities** - Unclear requirements or conflicting patterns (if any)

If all blank, agent refers to the command workflow defaults.
